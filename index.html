          I'm a Web developer from northern California. I've been coding for about 3 years, and most of that time has been spent teaching myself. I finally saved up enough to attend a Developer Bootcamp(<a class='devMtn-link' href='https://devmountain.com/'>DevMountain</a>). I'm currently attending it, and learning more than i thought possible in such a short time.

        <p class="about-text">
          I first got into coding after a buddy of mine attending a Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. Javascript was actually the first language I learned in my coding journey. From there I moved on to more advanced Javascript libraries such as angular, jQuery, react, & node.js. I've worked on numerous personal projects, most of which have since been deleted. I am currently working on a social media app to allow gamers to find lan parties near them. Also a search engine for api's.
