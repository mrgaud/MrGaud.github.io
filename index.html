				<p>well my coding journey all began when a buddy of mine enrolled in a programming bootcamp a few years ago.
				after seeing how much success he was having after he got out i decided it would be worth a shot.
			So i quit playing video games for about 6 months bought a macbook and began learning all i could.
			Javascript, html, css, bootstrap, you name it I was learning it (assuming it was part of web development).
			I found that the more projects i worked on the more fun I found it.
			So now I'm enrolled in a Coding bootcamp ("Dev Mountain") just trying to learn the stuff you cant on your own.
			My main goal in life now is to get my career off. I really wan't to work for a start-up for the chance to have a bigger impact on the company as a whole.
			Well thats my schtick so far this whole thing is subject to change at my will</p>
